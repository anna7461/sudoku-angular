## Navigation Behavior Summary

### **Smart Navigation Logic**

When a user is playing an arcade mode puzzle, the navigation behavior automatically adapts:

1. **Header Title Click** (`Sudoku` title in header)
   - **Always**: Navigates to `/` (main dashboard - global home)

2. **Back to Arcade Button** (only visible in arcade mode)
   - **Arcade Mode**: Navigates to `/arcade` (arcade dashboard)

3. **Continue Arcade Button** (in congratulations dialog)
   - **Arcade Mode**: Navigates to `/arcade` (arcade dashboard)

### **User Experience**

- **Arcade Mode Users**: Can easily return to arcade dashboard via dedicated button
- **Main Dashboard**: Always accessible via header title click
- **Clear Visual Distinction**: Different button styles for different navigation paths
- **Context-Aware**: UI adapts based on current game mode

## New Features

### Linear Roadmap Design
- **Visual**: Connected circles representing levels instead of grid boxes
- **Navigation**: Sequential progression with visual connections
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Difficulty Grouping**: Clear visual separation of difficulty sections

### Difficulty Sections
- **Easy Mode**: Levels 1-5 (Green theme)
- **Medium Mode**: Levels 6-10 (Orange theme)
- **Hard Mode**: Levels 11-15 (Red theme)
- **Expert Mode**: Levels 16-20 (Purple theme)

### Status Indicators
