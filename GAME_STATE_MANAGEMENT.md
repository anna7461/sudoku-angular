# Game State Management System

## Overview

The Angular Sudoku app now implements a robust state management system that ensures different game modes maintain separate, independent states. This prevents game states from overwriting each other and allows users to seamlessly switch between modes while preserving their progress.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GameStateService** - Central service managing all game mode states
2. **GameMode Enum** - Defines available game modes
3. **GameState Interface** - Standardized structure for game state data
4. **Updated Services** - Modified existing services to use the new state management

### Game Modes

- **DAILY_CHALLENGE** - Daily puzzle challenges with completion tracking
- **SINGLE_GAME** - Classic single-player sudoku puzzles
- **ARCADE_MODE** - Future endless challenge mode (coming soon)

## Key Features

### State Separation
- Each game mode maintains its own independent state
- States are stored separately in localStorage with unique keys
- No cross-contamination between different modes

### Persistent Storage
- Game states are automatically saved to localStorage
- States persist across browser sessions
- Automatic state restoration when returning to a mode

### Mode Switching
- Users can switch between modes without losing progress
- Each mode remembers its puzzle state, progress, and settings
- Seamless navigation between dashboard and game modes

## Implementation Details

### GameStateService Methods

```typescript
// Core state management
getCurrentMode(): GameMode
setCurrentMode(mode: GameMode): void
getCurrentGameState(): GameState | null
getGameState(mode: GameMode): GameState | null
saveGameState(gameState: Partial<GameState>): void
saveGameStateForMode(mode: GameMode, gameState: Partial<GameState>): void

// Game lifecycle
startNewGame(mode: GameMode, difficulty: string): void
clearGameState(mode: GameMode): void
completeGame(completionTime: number, score: number, mistakes: number): void

// State queries
hasGameState(mode: GameMode): boolean
hasAnySavedGame(): boolean
getSavedGameInfo(mode: GameMode): SavedGameInfo
```

### State Structure

```typescript
interface GameState {
  mode: GameMode;
  difficulty: string;
  boxes: any[];
  solution: number[][];
  fixedCells: boolean[][];
  mistakeCount: number;
  score: number;
  notesMode: boolean;
  numberFirstMode: boolean;
  selectedNumber: number | null;
  moveHistory: any[];
  gameStartTime: number | null;
  totalGameTime: number;
  isGamePaused: boolean;
  isCompleted: boolean;
  completionTime?: number;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Game

```typescript
// Start a new single game
this.gameStateService.startNewGame(GameMode.SINGLE_GAME, 'medium');

// Start a new daily challenge
this.gameStateService.startNewGame(GameMode.DAILY_CHALLENGE, 'hard');
```

### Saving Game State

```typescript
// Save current game state
this.gameStateService.saveGameState({
  boxes: this.boxes,
  difficulty: this.currentDifficulty,
  mistakeCount: this.mistakeCount,
  score: this.score
});
```

### Loading Game State

```typescript
// Get current mode's game state
const gameState = this.gameStateService.getCurrentGameState();

// Get specific mode's game state
const dailyChallengeState = this.gameStateService.getGameState(GameMode.DAILY_CHALLENGE);
```

## Migration from Old System

### Changes Made

1. **Removed direct localStorage usage** - All state operations now go through GameStateService
2. **Updated NewGameService** - Now supports mode-specific game creation
3. **Modified DashboardComponent** - Uses new state management for game mode handling
4. **Updated SudokuComponent** - Integrates with new state system for save/load operations

### Benefits

- **Cleaner separation of concerns** - State management is centralized
- **Better type safety** - Strong typing with TypeScript interfaces
- **Easier testing** - Services can be easily mocked and tested
- **Future extensibility** - New game modes can be added easily

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests to ensure:

- State separation between modes
- Proper state persistence and restoration
- Mode switching functionality
- Error handling and edge cases

Run tests with:
```bash
ng test
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Cloud sync** - Save states to user accounts
- **Statistics tracking** - Mode-specific performance metrics
- **Achievement system** - Cross-mode accomplishments
- **Multiplayer support** - Shared state management for collaborative play

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **State not persisting** - Check localStorage permissions and browser settings
2. **Mode switching issues** - Verify GameStateService is properly injected
3. **State corruption** - Use clearGameState() to reset problematic states

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging by checking browser console for:
- State save/load operations
- Mode changes
- Error messages

The system includes comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure robust operation.
